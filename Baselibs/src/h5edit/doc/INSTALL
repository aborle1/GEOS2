Instructions for the Installation of H5edit Tool
=====================================================

========
To build:
========
Assuming gmake and h5cc (HDF5 C compiler) are in your $PATH, just do
    % ./configure
    % gmake

The default C compiler is to h5cc.
If you want to use a specific h5cc compiler, do
    % env CC=$mypath/h5cc ./configure

To build with different compiler flags, use the CFLAGS variable, e.g.
     % env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
This command will set the compiling to "h5cc -O2".

============
To run tests:
============
    % gmake check

==========
To install:
==========
To install,
    % gmake install
These go to h5edit/bin of the built directory by default.  If you want
to install it somewhere else such as /usr/local/bin/h5edit,
    % gmake prefix=/usr/local install
