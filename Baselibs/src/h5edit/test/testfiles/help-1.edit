   --atomic level:
       Specifies the atomic level:
       yes: This is the default. It means the changes must be done as all or
            nothing. The original data file is restored in case of any command
            failures.
       no:  No atomicity is desired. Do as much changes as possible.
       inc: Atomicity of changes at individual command level is desired, not
            the entire execution.

       in the H5edit Command Language, to apply to the file h5file.

       without making the actual changes to the HDF5 file.
