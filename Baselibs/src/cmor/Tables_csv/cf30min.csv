"The sampling interval must be the integer multiple of the model time-step that is nearest a half hour. Outputs should be instantaneous (not time mean) and from nearest gridbox (no spatial interpolation.)  Note that except for the quantities appearing in the Amon spreadsheet (first line of table below), all other fields are 3-D. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
