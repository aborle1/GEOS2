#
# description:
# 	This file defines environment variables used by HDFEOS5.
# 	This version is for use under the Korn shell (ksh).
#
# usage:
# 	This file should be called from your .profile file with the line:
#
# 	    . <HDFEOS5-home-dir>/bin/hdfeos_env.ksh
#	
# 	where <HDFEOS5-home-dir> is the full path of the HDFEOS5 home directory.

#       Guru Tej S. Khalsa / Applied Research Corporation
#       Abe Taaheri / Emergent Information Technologies, Inc.
#
# notes:
# 	1) This file is compatible with the following platforms:
# 	   Sun, SGI, HP-9000, IBM RS-6000 and DEC Alpha.
# 	   It automatically figures out which platform you are on,
# 	   and sets environment variables accordingly.
# 	2) This file defines a variable called hdfeos5_path which contains
# 	   all the directories likely to be needed on a given machine
# 	   type, including the HDFEOS5 bin directories.  Users 
# 	   may choose to set their path variable with:
# 	   
# 	           PATH=<user-path-additions>:$hdfeos5_path
# 	           export PATH
#
# 	   where <user-path-additions> is an optional list of other
# 	   directories added to the search path.
