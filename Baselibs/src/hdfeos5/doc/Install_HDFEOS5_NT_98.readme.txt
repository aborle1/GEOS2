The instructions which follow assume that you will be using
the 'zip' files that we provide: hdfeos5.1.9b.zip (binary file 
for Windows 98/NT) and hdfeos5.1.9.zip (source code file). 



Building from Binary Code Release (hdfeos5.1.9b.zip)
===============================================
To install the HDFEOS with the prebuilt libraries, it is assumed that 
you have done the following:      

      NOTE: THE FOLLOWING INTSTRUTIONS SHOULD BE FINE FOR BOTH WINNT AND WIN98

      1. Go to the website edhs1.gsfc.nasa.gov, under directory 
	 hdfeos5/window you can download: hdfeos5.1.9b.zip.

      2. On you window, create a directory structure to unpack the 
	 source file. For example: 
	    c:\					(any drive)
           	MyHDFEOS5\		       	(any folder name)
        

      3. Copy the hdfeos5.1.9b.zip to that directory 
         and unpack it by running WinZip on it.
         This should create the following directories: hdfeos5, 
	 jpeg, Zlib-1.1.3, and szip1.2

	 The libraries and include files for hdfeos5.1.9 are inside:
            c:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\lib\NT_98  ( Release versions of hdfeos 
					      and gctp libraries
					    (hdfeos5.lib, gctp.lib))
	
            c:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\include      ( HDFEOS5 include files )   
	 Inside the directories Zlib-1.1.3, jpeg and szip1.2
	 You can find their include files and libraries (zlib.lib, libjpeg.lib 
	 and szlib.lib).

      4. If you are building an application that uses the HDFEOS5 library,
         you must already have installed NSCA hdf5 (curren version that 
	 we're using is 5-1.6.3) on your machine. 
         
         Assumed you have installed hdf5-1.6.3 on
            
            C:\MyHDF5\

         To specify the header files and linking in the HDFEOS libraries:
	 Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
	 "Include files", add the following directories:
	    F:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\INCLUDE
            F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Include                   
            F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\INCLUDE
            C:\MyHDFEOS5\jpeg
	    C:\MyHDFEOS5\Zlib-1.1.3\include
	    C:\MyHDFEOS5\szip1.2\include
	    C:\myHDF5\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\include
            C:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\include
	
	Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
	"Libraries files", add the following directories:
	    F:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\LIB
	    F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\LIB
	    F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Lib
            C:\MyHDFEOS5\jpeg
	    C:\MyHDFEOS5\Zlib-1.1.3\lib
	    C:\MyHDFEOS5\szip1.2\lib
	    C:\myHDF5\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\lib
            C:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\lib\NT_98
	NOTE: Please see Compile_NT_98.readme.txt inside hdfeos5/doc
	      for more details.


Building from Source Code Release (hdfeos5.1.9.zip)
===============================================

STEP I:  Preconditions

To build the HDFEOS5, it is assumed that you have done the following:
      
      1. Installed MicroSoft Developer Studio and Visual C++ 5.0.
    
      2. Installed jpeg, szip and zlib (see install_jpeg_zlib_szip.txt)
         
      3. Installed NSCA hdf5 (current we're using is 1.6.3).

      4. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library. For 
      example: 

	    c:\				(any drive)
           MyHDFEOS5\			(any folder name)

      5. Copy the source distribution archive to that directory 
      and unpack it using the appropriate archiver options to create a 
      directory hierarchy.
         
      Run WinZip on hdfeos5.1.9.zip (the entire source tree).
      This should create a directory called 'hdfeos5_dev' which 
      contains several files and directories for Win95/98 and NT, a 
      directory called 'hdfeos5' which contains the hdfeos5 package.

STEP II: Build HDFEOS5 library

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION           

         1. Open  c:\myHDFEOS5\hdfeos5_dev\hdfeos5.dsw to begin building the 
            Developer Studio project. When you see the pop up box "Browse for            project hdfeos5", please select the right location for
	    hdfeos5.dsp.  For example, you install hdfeos5 under C:\MyHDFEOS5, 
	    so you can select the location for hdfeos5.dsp as
            c:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5_dev\hdfeos5\hdfeos5.dsp

         2. Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
	    "Include files", add the following directories:

	    	F:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\INCLUDE
            	F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Include                   
            	F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\INCLUDE
	        C:<path to jpeg>\jpeg  
		C:<path to zlib>\include
		C:<path to szlib>\include      
                C:<path to HDF5>\include 
                C:<path to HDFEOS5>\include 
	       
	 3. Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
	    "Libraries files", add the following directories:
	  	C:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\LIB
                C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\LIB
                C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\LIB
	        C:<path to jpeg lib>\jpeg  
		C:<path to zlib>\lib
		C:<path to szlib>\lib
		C:<path to HDF5>\lib

	    where <path to HDF> may be C:\myHDF5\hdf5         
            where <path to HDFEOS> may be C:\myHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\

	4. Select Project->Settings, select forder, C/C++
   	   Add the following to "Preprocessor definitions": 
   	   VISUAL_CPLUSPLUS, INTEL86	 

	5. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".
            Select "hdfeos5 - Win32Debug" as active configuration.
            Select "Build" and "Build hdfeos5d.lib" to
            build the Debug version of the hdfeos5 tree.

	6. Select "Build", then Select "Set Active Configuration".
            Select "hdfeos5 - Win32Release" as active configuration.
            Select "Build" and "Build hdfeos5.lib" to
            build the Release version of the hdfeos5 tree.

	7. gctp libraries for debug and release versions was
	    already in hdfeos5/lib/nt_98: gctpd.lib, gctp.lib.
	    Or if you want to build them, you can use hdfeos2 stuff.
	   

        8. In command prompt window run the installation batch commands
            win32ins.bat in directory C:\myHDFEOS5\hdfeos5_dev. These commands 
	    will copy *.lib files to C:\MyHDFEOS5\hdfeos5\lib\NT_98 
	    and remove some temporary files.

        9. If you are building an application that uses the HDFEOS5 library,
            Please refer to the <HDFEOS5 directory>\hdfeos5_dev\compile_NT_98.txt 
            file for more information on compiling an application with the 
	    HDFEOS5 libraries on Windows 95/98 and Window NT.

MORE HELPFUL POINTERS
=====================

Here are some notes that may be of help is you are not familiar
with using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

Project name and location issues: 
         The files in hdfeos5.dsw must end up in the hdfeos5_dev\ directory

         If you must install hdfeos5.dsw in another directory, relative to 
	 hdfeos5_dev\ , you will be asked to locate the hdfeos and gctp project files, 
	 when you open the project hdfeos.dsw.

Settings... details:
  If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be
  read from the hdfeos5.dsw file(as text), or from the
  Project Settings in the Developer Studio project settings 
dialog.
