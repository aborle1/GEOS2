                  The Simplified Baselibs
                         Aug 2016
                  -----------------------

This module contains a simplified version of the "baselibs" module
first developed by Gerhard Theurich and later matained by Eugene
Mirvis. The current version only includes a minimal set of libraries
needed for building GEOS-5 at NASA/GSFC.

   - ESMF
   - NetCDF-4 (C and Fortran interfaces)
   - UDUNITS 2
   - HDF-4
   - HDF-5, zlib, jpeg
   - zlib
   - szlib
   - jpeg
   - HDF-EOS2
   - HDF-EOS5
   - NCO
   - curl
   - cmor
   - uuid
   - CDO
   - h5edit
   - pFUnit

The top GNUmakefile also has provisions for building an *essential* set:

   - ESMF
   - NetCDF (built without NetCDF-4/HDF-5 support)

Consult the ChangeLog of the specific version number of these pakages.

A much larger set of packages (but not including ESMF and HDFEOS) is
mantained by the OpenGrADS project at:

            http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=161773 

Packages such as HDF-5 and OPeNDAP have already been implemented
there in a structure very similar to this one and can be imported very
easily if need arises.
