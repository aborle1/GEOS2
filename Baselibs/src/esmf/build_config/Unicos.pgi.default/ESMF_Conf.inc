Define the proper way to flush Fortran units.  Typically this will
be one of the following:

  * Fortran-2003 FLUSH statement (preferred and default)
  * Two argument FLUSH call
  * One argument FLUSH call

#if (ESMF_PGIVERSION_MAJOR < 8)
#define ESMF_IOFlushMacro(unit,status) call flush (unit)
#endif

#if 0
Define the proper way to read the command line.

By default, the F2003 command line instrinsics will be used.

Use getarg code for pre-11.2 compilers to avoid PGI library bug.

PGI 11.5 and previous have a bug when creating named constants which
are arrays of zero length.  See ticket #3341575.

Older PGI compiler were strict F90, and did not allow derived type
components to have F95 initializers.  This allows all other architectures
to have them by letting us write conditional code.

Older PGI compilers had a bug which prevents forward pointer references from
working if also using the sequence keyword.  for PGI only, dont sequence
the State derived types.
