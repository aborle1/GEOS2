\label{sec:AttPacks}

At this time, all ESMF objects which are enabled to contain Attributes can also contain Attribute packages, which are groupings of individual Attributes.  Every Attribute package is specified by a {\bf convention} and a {\bf purpose}, hereafter called {\bf specifiers}, such as "CF" and "General" (see below).  These specifiers are used to validate ESMF Attribute packages against existing metadata conventions.  The user can choose to use an ESMF pre-defined Attribute package, specify their own Attribute package, or add customized Attributes to any of the ESMF pre-defined Attribute packages. Currently, the creation and setting of Attribute packages is quite involved, but future development with IO will allow for a more automated approach to populating Attribute packages from a file.  This is already possible via {\tt ESMF\_AttributeRead()} for the ESMF/ESG/CF Attribute packages supplied by ESMF, as well as for custom individual Attributes not in a package.

The standard Attribute packages supplied by ESMF exist for the following ESMF objects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CplComp
    \item GridComp
    \item State
    \item Field
    \item Array
    \item Grid
\end{itemize}

The packages described in this section are grouped by the ESMF object they apply to. The creation of custom attributes and custom attribute packages is also possible and is discussed in Section \ref{sec:CustomAttPacks}. In some cases it is possible to nest custom packages on top of ESMF packages. Attribute package nesting is described separately in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.

Some Attributes come with a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary is a list of options that can be selected as the value of the attribute. The controlled vocabularies listed in this documentation represent those chosen by the community. They are not exhaustive and users may set these Attributes to a different value if they so choose. The primary consequence of doing so is that the resulting output may not be recognized by any of the online tools being developed with respect to this controlled vocabulary.  


\subsubsection{Component Attribute packages}
\label{ComponentAttributePackages}

There are many attributes that are used to describe components. There are currently 4 predefined component-level Attribute packages, with sub-packages defined for the 2nd:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Earth System Grid (ESG) Basic
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Main
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Common Information Model (CIM) Platform
        \item International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Responsible Party
        \item International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Citation
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Scientific Properties
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Component Properties
\end{enumerate}

{\bf 2. Common Information Model (CIM) Main Attribute Package}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: CIM
    \item Purpose: Model Component Simulation Description
    \item Includes:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item CIM Platform

    \end{itemize}
    \item Output Options: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CIM XML
    \end{itemize}  
    \item Description: The CIM is a formal model of the climate modeling process being developed by the European Union's \htmladdnormallink{METAFOR}{http://metaforclimate.eu/} project. "It includes descriptions of the experiments being undertaken, the simulations being run in support of these experiments, the software models and tools being used to implement the simulations and the data generated by the software." The CIM divides up the climate modeling process into 6 sections, listed below. The CIM also contains other standards. It is the primary metadata representation for the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). ESMF is currently implementing only a subset of the CIM. The representation is expected to grow. The CIM Main Package contains several standalone properties used to describe components. It also serves as the anchor to which other CIM packages are nested. Presently, these additional CIM packages (described further below) can only be created if the CIM Main Package is created. In the future, these packages will be decoupled, so that users may select subsections of the CIM to create and use. This package nests three of the packages below within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Shared: Contains those elements that are used in many different packages. 
       \item Quality: Contains elements used to express diverse quality metrics for CIM Metadata or for artifacts that the CIM metadata describes.
       \item Grids: Provides a complete description of the horizontal and vertical discretization of modeling elements. This may refer to grids that output data is mapped onto, software adheres to, as well as activity constraints. 
       \item Activity: Specifies the experimental design including the experimental requirements and description of how simulations conform to these requirements.
       \item Software: Specifies all the modeling software components used within the experiment process. 
       \item Data: Describes the data output from the climate modeling process as well as for input data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: ISO 19115
    \item Purpose: Citation Description
    \item Output Options: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CIM XML 
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Description: This package is used to describe references. Examples include a URL or a scientific reference.  This package is nested, with one or more user-specifiable instances, within the CIM Main Package (above); see the description in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.

    \item Output Options: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CIM XML
    \end{itemize}  
    \item Description: This package is used to specify any number of custom, user-defined attributes of a component and have them output in valid CIM XML format.  This differs from the scientific properties package above in that the names and values are custom, not part of any controlled vocabulary.  It also differs from a custom attribute package (see Section \ref{sec:CustomAttPacks}) in that this package has a standard convention and purpose, which is used to control the output of the user-defined attributes in standard CIM XML format.  One or more values can be set (via an array) for an attribute name.

\subsubsection{Field Attribute packages}
\label{FieldAttributePackages}

Several standards exist to describe fields. There are currently 4 predefined Field-level Attribute packages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Inputs
    \item Earth System Grid General
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention Extended
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention General
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.20in}

{\bf 1. Common Information Model (CIM) Inputs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: CIM
    \item Purpose: Inputs Description
    \item Includes: 
    \begin{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CIM XML 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Description: This package is used to describe a simulation and the input (initial and boundary) conditions used in that simulation. It is also used to describe any ancillary data sets that contain input condition variables. This package should not be used to describe the variables in an unconfigured model component. A pre-defined Attribute package for that case will be implemented in a future release of ESMF.  This package nests the ESG (or ESMF) General, CF Extended, and CF General Field packages (below) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.  The attribute values within these ESG and CF nested packages currently appear in the Component Properties section of the CIM output file.  A separate Component Properties package may be developed for this purpose in a future ESMF release.

This attribute is assigned to individual variables.   This package nests the CF Extended and CF General packages (below) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{4cm}|}
     \hline\hline
     {\bf Name } & {\bf Definition} & {\bf Controlled Vocabulary} \\

{\bf 3. Climate Forecast (CF) Convention Extended}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: CF
    \item Purpose: Extended
    \item Includes:

        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM Inputs package)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Description: The CF standard for fields contains an optional standard\_name Attribute. Standard names are controlled vocabularies and not every variable in the earth system sciences contains a standard name. Because of this, ESMF implemented this optional Attribute in its own package. This package nests the CF General package (below) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.

        \item Simple XML
        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM Inputs package)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item  Description: The climate and forecast (CF) convention contains metadata that is designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API. The CF conventions are increasingly gaining acceptance and have been adopted by a number of projects and groups as a primary standard. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The ESMF CF Attribute package contains the three mandatory Attributes required to describe fields.

    {\tt ShortName*}  & The short\_name is technically not part of the CF standard but is commonly the name of the variable on the output file and so is
 distinct from the long\_name & N/A \\
    {\tt Units}  & The value of the units attribute is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA's Udunits package & N/A\\
    \hline\hline
\end{tabular}

\label{GridAttributePackages}

There are 2 grid attribute packages in ESMF. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item GFDL Gridspec
    \item ESMF Grid
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.20in}

{\bf 1. Gridspec}

\label{CIMGridAttributePackage}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: GridSpec
    \item Purpose: General
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple XML
        \item If combined with the ESMF Grid package, this package can be used to create a Grid object by reading in an XML file with these attributes. This is currently limited to 2D regularly distributed rectinlinear grids. See Section \ref{example:GridCrFromFile} for details. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Description: This package contains the Attributes developed as part of GFDL's Gridspec standard.
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline\hline
{\bf Name} & {\bf Definition} & {\bf Controlled Vocabulary} \\
\hline\hline
{\tt CongruentTiles} & Indicates whether or not all the tiles contained within a grid mosaic are of the same size and shape. & True, False \\
{\tt DimensionOrder} & The order in which latitude and longitude appear within the two dimensional grid array. & N/A \\ 
{\tt DiscretizationType} & Specifies the method by which a two-dimensional coordinate system is sampled to form a computational grid. &  Logically rectangular, Pixel-based catchment, Structured triangular, Unstructured triangular\\ 
{\tt GeometryType} & Indicates the geometric figure used to approximate the shape of the Earth, e.g. "sphere".& Ellipsoid, Plane, Sphere\\ 
{\tt GridType} & A text description of the grid that uses common terminology. & Gnomonic,Cubed Sphere,Displaced Pole, Icosahedral geodesic, Reduced gaussian, Regular lat lon, Spectral gaussian, Tripolar, Yin Yang\\ 
{\tt HorizontalResolution} & The number of points within the horizontal domain of a model or grid. & N/A \\
{\tt IsConformal} & Indicates if the grid tile is angle-preserving. If so, angles measured on the grid are equal to the equivalent angles on the Earth. & True, False\\ 
{\tt IsRegular} & Indicates whether or not the horizontal coordinates of the grid can be defined using 1D arrays (vectors). This means that grid node locations are defined by the cartesian product of the X/Lon and Y/Lat coordinate vectors. It also means that grid cells are logically rectangular (they may also be physically rectangular in the case of projected coordinates). & True, False\\ 
{\tt IsUniform} &Indicates whether or not the horizontal coordinates of a grid have fixed offsets in the X and Y directions. If the offset is the same in both directions then the grid is logically square, otherwise it is logically rectangular. & True, False\\ 
{\tt NorthPoleLocation} & Defines the lat-long position of the 'north pole' used by the grid tile in the case of rotated/displaced pole grids.& N/A \\ 
{\tt NumberOfCells} & The number of cells in an unstructured grid. & N/A\\ 
{\tt NumberOfGridTiles} & The number of tiles in a mosaic. & N/A \\
{\tt NX} & Specifies the length of the X, or longitude, dimension of the grid tile. & N/A \\ 
{\tt NY} & Specifies the length of the Y, or latitude, dimension of the grid tile. & N/A \\

{\bf 2. ESMF Grid}

\label{ESMFGridAttributePackage}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Convention: ESMF
    \item Purpose: General
    \item Includes: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GridSpec General
    \end{itemize}
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple XML
        \item If combined with the Gridspec Package, this package can be used to create a Grid object by reading in an XML file with these attributes. This is currently limited to 2D regularly distributed logically-rectangular grids. See Section \ref{example:GridCrFromFile} for details. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Description: This package contains two Attributes required by ESMF to generate grids from a file. They describe the decomposition of a grid across ESMF DEs.  This package nests the GridSpec General package (above) within it; this is described in Section \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}.

\subsubsection{Custom Attribute packages}
\label{sec:CustomAttPacks}

ESMF allows for the creation of custom attribute packages, each of which has a user-defined convention and purpose, as well as a set of user-defined attributes. This can be done to augment one of the pre-defined packages (via package nesting \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}) or to create a suite of attributes unique to the user. A custom attribute package currently outputs only in simple XML format, when used as a stand-alone package (not when used to augment a pre-defined package).  Examples of how to create such custom packages are contained in Sections \ref{ex:AttributePackageEx} and \ref{ex:AttributeCustPackEx}.
