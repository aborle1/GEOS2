\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Months per year set to 12.} Due to the requirement of only Earth modeling, the number of months per year is hard-coded at 12.  However, for easy modification, this is implemented via a C preprocessor \#define MONTHS\_PER\_YEAR in ESMCI\_Calendar.h.

\item {\bf ESMF\_CALKIND\_CUSTOM partially implemented.} Currently, a user-defined calendar can be created, but no operations with an {\tt ESMF\_Time} or {\tt ESMF\_TimeInterval} are supported.  Most notably, performing an {\tt ESMF\_TimeSet()} and time-stepping via {\tt ESMF\_ClockAdvance()} using a custom calendar are not currently supported.  Also, there is no provision for a custom calendar to define a leap year rule, so {\tt ESMF\_CalendarIsLeapYear()} will always return {\tt .false.} in this case.

\end{enumerate}
