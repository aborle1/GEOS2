An ESMF Field represents a physical field, such as temperature.
The motivation for including Fields in ESMF is that bundles of 
Fields are the entities that are normally exchanged when coupling
Components.  

The ESMF Field class contains distributed and discretized field data, a reference 
to its associated grid, and metadata.  The Field class stores the grid {\it staggering}
for that physical field.
This is the relationship of how the data array of a field maps onto a grid 
(e.g. one item per
cell located at the cell center, one item per cell located at the NW
corner,  one item per cell vertex, etc.).  This means that different Fields
which are on the same underlying ESMF Grid but have different
staggerings can share the same Grid object without needing to replicate
it multiple times. 

Fields can be added to States for use in inter-Component
data communications.  Fields can also be added to FieldBundles,
which are groups of Fields on the same underlying Grid.  
One motivation for packing Fields into FieldBundles is convenience; 
another is the ability to perform optimized collective data transfers.  

Field communication capabilities include: data redistribution, regridding, scatter,
gather, sparse-matrix multiplication, and halo update.  These are discussed
in more detail in the documentation for the specific method calls.  
ESMF does not currently support vector fields, so the components of 
a vector field must be stored as separate Field objects.
