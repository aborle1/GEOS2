# Submitted to Stu Ross 20130228

(20130520: Notes on future SURF-IT ads:
1. Make first affiliation CS not ESS to get more CS applicants
2. Format ads so Windows line-breaking won't create widows/orphans
3. Prerequisites: Good programming skills at the level of third year
computer science. Proficiency with C and a scripting language.)

Optimized Storage Shapes for Multi-dimensional Gridded Datasets

PI: Prof. Charlie Zender
    Departments of Earth System Science and Computer Science

Description:
Many if not most geophysical datasets such as climate simulations
are stored in a self-describing data format called netCDF. 
Data access speeds vary by factors of thousands, and depends primarily
upon how well their storage layout matches the hyperslab request.  
This project will improve understanding and parameterization of the
optimal layout (i.e., the "chunking") to maximize fast access and
minimize slow access to netCDF datasets.

Our netCDF Operators (NCO) are a widely used, opensource toolkit for
manipulating and analyzing (statistics, trends, comparison with
observations) netCDF data. NCO supports a range of chunking policies,
but has no heuristic for guiding the user on optimal chunking.
The student will first conduct sensitivity tests to benchmark access
times for common hyperslab requests. Then the student will construct
and implement new, optimal chunking policies. 

The first few weeks would be devoted to literature review and to
scripting benchmark tests to assess the dependence of wallclock time
on data layout. The next few weeks would be analysis and hypothesis
testing of generic chunking policies motivated by the benchmarking
results. The last few weeks would be implementation and analysis of
optimized chunking policies in NCO.

Prerequisites: Proficiency with C and multi-dimensional data

Outcomes: Skills and understanding of scientific data analysis,
benchmarking, interpretation of results.

Next Generation Parser for Structured Data Analysis

PI: Prof. Charlie Zender
    Departments of Earth System Science and Computer Science

Description:
Many if not most geophysical datasets such as climate simulations
are stored in a self-describing data format called netCDF. Our netCDF
Operators (NCO) are a widely used, opensource toolkit for manipulating
and analyzing (statistics, trends, comparison with observations)
netCDF data. 

This project will utilize ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language
Recognition) to generate the NCO language parser in C++. Our goals are  
two-fold: 1. To create and efficient, extensible parser for structured
data analysis. 2. To enhance parallelism in geophysical data analysis
involving structured data with storage constraints.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with C/C++ and data

Outcomes: Skills and understanding of scientific language construction, data
analysis, open source software development and climate change.
