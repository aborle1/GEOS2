 
COMPILING A PROGRAM
                  
Following are instructions for compiling an application program on the 
window NT and window 95/98, using the hdfeos binaries that we provide or 
you build.

Make sure that you already had all following libraries before you start
to compile an application program:  libjpeg.lib, zlib.lib, szlib.lib, 
hd420.lib, hm420.lib, hdfeos.lib, gctp.lib.

NOTE: The current versions that we're using: jpeg6b, zlib1.1.3
szip1.2, HDF4.2r0, HDFEOS2.13.
If you want to use the latest versions of jpeg, zlib and szlib, 
go to ncsa website (ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/lib-external)
to download.

C or Fortran program :
-------------
Using Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.x or later version for C program:
Using Digitalt Visual Fortran version 5.x or later version for 

For example, you want to run the hdfeos testdrivers:
Go to /hdfeos/testdrivers/
Open a testdriver (for example /swath/testswath.c) by clicking it.
Select Build->"compile testswath.c" to invoke it into 
a workspace.

Select Build->Set Active Configuration->testswath-Win32Release->OK


Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
"Include files", add the following directories:
	F:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\INCLUDE
        F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\Include                   
        F:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\INCLUDE
	C:<path to jpeg>\jpeg  
	C:<path to zlib>\include
	C:<path to szlib>\include      
        C:<path to HDF>\include 
        C:<path to HDFEOS>\include 
	C:<path to HDFEOS>\gctp\include

Select Tools->Options->Directories->"Show directories for"->
"Libraries files", add the following directories:
	C:\Program Files\ArrayVisualizer\LIB
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\LIB
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\LIB
	C:<path to jpeg lib>\jpeg  
	C:<path to zlib>\lib
	C:<path to szlib>\lib
	C:<path to HDF>\lib
	C:<path to HDFEOS>\lib\nt_98

Select Project->Settings, select forder, C/C++
   Add the following to "Preprocessor definitions": 
   VISUAL_CPLUSPLUS, INTEL86
The following were already there:   WIN32,_CONSOLE

Select Project->Settings, select folder, Link:
  
   Add the following libraries to the beginning of the list of
   Object/Library Modules:
   
   Swath & Point:
   ==============
      ws2_32.lib hdfeos.lib hd420.lib hm420.lib libjpeg.lib zlib.lib szlib.lib

   Grid
   ====
      ws2_32.lib hdfeos.lib gctp.lib hd420.lib hm420.lib libjpeg.lib zlib.lib szlib.lib

   The following libraries may (or may not) need to be included: 
       kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdig32.lib
       advapi32lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib
       odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib

NOTE: hdfeos.lib and gctp.lib are Release Version.
      hdfeosd.lib is Debug version.

Select Build and "Build testswath.exe"

To run the executable file, for example, testswath.exe

Open MS-Dos, go to ../testdrivers/swath/release and run testswath.exe to get the output. 

NOTE: Before running testpoint.exe, you should copy all ".txt" files to release
      folder.

NOTE: Deal to the Fortran problem with HDF on windows, HDFEOS fortran testdrivers doesn't 
      support the windows.  C is good.
