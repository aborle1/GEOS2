Installation Instructions
=========================

    Preliminary
    -----------

    Before installing HDFEOS, you must already have installed NCSA HDF,
    version 4.1 release 5, on your host.  The installation script will prompt
    for the paths to the HDF include and library directories.


    Unpacking the distribution file
    -------------------------------

    1)  Select a location for the HDFEOS directory tree.  Installing
        HDFEOS alone requires a disk partition with at least 25 Mb  
        of free space.  

    2)  Copy the file HDF-EOS2.8v1.00.tar.Z to the target directory by  
        typing the command:
    
    	    cp HDF-EOS2.8v1.00.tar.Z <target-dir>
    
        where <target-dir> is the full pathname of your target directory.
         
    3)  Set your default directory to the target directory by typing 
        the command:
    
            cd <target-dir>
    
    4)  Uncompress this file and extract the contents by typing the command:
    
    	    zcat HDF-EOS2.8v1.00.tar.Z | tar xvf -

        This will create a subdirectory of the current directory 
        called 'hdfeos'.  This is the top-level HDFEOS directory,  
        which contains the full HDFEOS directory structure.


    Starting the installation procedure
    -----------------------------------

    1)  Set your default directory to the top-level HDFEOS directory by  
        typing the command:
    
            cd hdfeos

    2) Select installation options.
    
       Currently, the only options are those specific to the SGI Power 
       Challenge platform.
 
       On the SGI Power Challenge, the default is to build HDFEOS in
       64-bit mode.  The following table gives the option
       to specify the appropriate architecture to be built:

            binary format	architecture	<install-options>
            -------------	------------	---------------
            old-style 32 bit	sgi		-sgi
            new-style 32 bit    sgi32		-sgi32
            64 bit         	sgi64		<default>

	Please note that the old-32-bit mode has been dropped as the default 
	because it is no longer being supported by SGI, it is therefore 
	recommended that all users migrate to new-style 32 bit or 64 bit mode.

    3)  Run the installation script. 

        Please note that the installation script for this release of  
        HDFEOS requires user interaction.  Because of this, it should NOT 
        be run as a background task.  
        
        3.0) (optional)
            If you wish to generate a log of this session, use the Unix 
            'script' command.  This command runs a sub-shell that saves 
            all terminal output to the specified file.  
            
            To log the session, type:
        
              script <logfile-name>

            where <logfile-name> is the name of the log file.

        3.1) 
           To run the installation script, type the command:
    
             bin/INSTALL-HDFEOS <install-options>
    
           where <install-options> is the list of options determined in
           the previous step.

           The installation script will then run.  It will output various
           startup messages, beginning with:

             HDFEOS installation starting at <date/time>

        3.2) 
           Enter the full pathnames for the HDF4.1 library and include  
           directory paths, when the script prompts for them.  If there
           is an error in the supplied paths, the script will exit.
        
          NOTE:
            If the environment variables HDFLIB and/or HDFINC are set
            in your shell, the script will use these for the default values.
            If this is not the first run of the script, the default values
            will be taken from the values used for the last run of the script.
        
            In either of these cases, the installation script will prompt with:
        
              Current value of the HDF library directory is: <path>
              Accept [y]/n:  

            and/or

              Current value of the HDF include directory is: <path>
              Accept [y]/n:  

            Make sure to type 'n' and hit return, if the defaults do not 
            point to the correct directories.  The script will then prompt 
            for the new values.
        

         3.3) 
            The installation script will finish with the following message:
    
              HDFEOS installation ending at <date/time>

         3.4) (optional - see 3.0) 
            If you ran the Unix 'script' command to create a log file, then
            type 'exit' and hit return at the command prompt.  This will 
            exit the sub-shell stated by 'script' and save the log file.
        
            HINT:
              The log file generated by the script command may contain 'hard
              return' characters at the end of each line.  These appear in
              some text editors as "^M".   They can be removed with the 
              following command:
          
                sed 's/.$//' <logfile-name> > <logfile-name>.new
            
              where <logfile-name> is the name of the log file.



    User Account Setup
    ------------------

    Once HDFEOS has been installed, the accounts of HDFEOS users
    must be set up to define environment variables needed to compile and
    run code with HDFEOS (see parts 2 and 3 of the Notes section, below).
    The type of setup depends on the user's login shell.
    
    1A) C shell (csh) users:

        Edit the HDFEOS user's .cshrc file to include the
        following line:

 	    source <HDFEOS-home-dir>/bin/$BRAND/hdfeos_env.csh  
	
 	where <HDFEOS-home-dir> is the full path of the HDFEOS home 
        directory, and $BRAND is an architecture-specific value for 
        your host.  Please refer to part 2 of the Notes section, 
        below, to determine the correct value.

        The script hdfeos_env.csh sets up all the variables discussed in 
        parts 2 and 3 of the Notes section, below, and it adds the HDFEOS 
        bin directory to the user path. 

        The environment variables will become available during all 
        subsequent login sessions.  To activate them for the current 
        session, simply type one of the two lines listed above, at the
        Unix prompt.

        Note regarding path setup with hdfeos_env.csh
        ----------------------------------------------
            The script hdfeos_env.csh also makes available a variable
            called hdfeos_path.  This can be added to the user's path to
            ensure that it accesses the directories necessary for the
            compilers and other utilities used to generate executable
            programs.  It is not added to the user path by default,
            because in many cases it adds unnecessary complexity to
            the user path.  To add hdfeos_path to the user path, modify
            the HDFEOS user's .cshrc file to include the following:

                set my_path = ($path)			# save path
                source <HDFEOS-HOME-DIR>/bin/$BRAND/hdfeos_env.csh # HDFEOS setup
                set path = ($my_path $hdfeos_path)	# add hdfeos_path 

            INSTEAD OF the line listed at the beginning of this step.  
            Note that it is the user's responsibility to set up 
            his or her own path so that it doesn't duplicate the 
            directories set up in hdfeos_path.  Please also note that the 
            hdfeos_path is added AFTER the user's path.  This way, the 
            user's directories will be searched first when running Unix 
            commands.

    1B) Korn shell (ksh) users:

        Edit the HDFEOS user's .profile file to include the following line:

 	    . <HDFEOS-home-dir>/bin/$BRAND/hdfeos_env.ksh  
	
 	where <HDFEOS-home-dir> is the full path of the HDFEOS home 
        directory, and $BRAND is an architecture-specific value for 
        your host.  Please refer to part 2 of the Notes section, 
        below, to determine the correct value.

        The script hdfeos_env.ksh sets up all the variables discussed in 
        part 2 and 3 of the Notes section, below, and it adds the HDFEOS 
        bin directory to the user path. 

        The environment variables will become available during all 
        subsequent login sessions.  To activate them for the current 
        session, simply type one of the two lines listed above, at the
        Unix prompt.

        Note regarding path setup with hdfeos_env.ksh
        ----------------------------------------------
            The script hdfeos_env.ksh also makes available a variable
            called hdfeos_path.  This can be added to the user's path to
            ensure that it accesses the directories necessary for the
            compilers and other utilities used to generate executable
            programs.  It is not added to the user path by default,
            because in many cases it adds unnecessary complexity to
            the user path.  To add hdfeos_path to the user path, modify
            the HDFEOS user's .profile file to include the following:

                my_path="$PATH"				    # save path
                . <HDFEOS-HOME-DIR>/bin/$BRAND/hdfeos_env.ksh # HDFEOS setup
                PATH="$my_path:$hdfeos_path" ; export PATH     # add hdfeos_path 

            INSTEAD OF the line listed at the beginning of this step.  
            Note that it is the user's responsibility to set up 
            his or her own path so that it doesn't duplicate the 
            directories set up in hdfeos_path.  Please also note that the 
            hdfeos_path is added AFTER the user's path.  This way, the 
            user's directories will be searched first when running Unix 
            commands.

    1C) Bourne shell (sh) users:

        Set up the required HDFEOS environment variables by appending  
        the contents of the file <HDFEOS-home-dir>/bin/$BRAND/hdfeos_env.ksh 
        to the end of the HDFEOS user's .profile, where <HDFEOS-home-dir> 
        is the full path of the HDFEOS home directory, and $BRAND is an 
        architecture-specific value for your host.  Please refer to part
        2 of the Notes section, below, to determine the correct value.

        The environment variables will become available during all 
        subsequent login sessions.  To activate them, log out and
        then log back in.
    

    File Cleanup
    ------------

    Once HDFEOS has been built and tested, you can delete certain 
    temporary files and directories to save some disk space.   Note 
    that once these files have been removed, you will need to unpack 
    the original distribution file in order to re-do the installation.

    To remove these files:
    
        cd <HDFEOS-home-dir>/bin
        rm -rf tmp
        cd <HDFEOS-home-dir>/lib
        rm -rf tmp
 


    Compiling and Linking with HDFEOS
    ---------------------------------
    
    In order to compile and link programs with the HDFEOS you must
    access the HDFEOS include and library files.   To do this be
    sure that your makefiles include something like the following:


    INCLUDE = -I. -I$(HDFEOS_INC) -I$(HDFINC)
    LIBRARY = -L. -L$(HDFEOS_LIB) -L$(HDFLIB)


    LDFLAGS = -lhdfeos -lGctp -lmfhdf -ldf -ljpeg -lnsl -lz -lm (Sun platform)
    LDFLAGS = -lhdfeos -lGctp -lmfhdf -ldf -ljpeg -lz -lm	(others)


    The environment variables HDFEOS_INC, HDFEOS_LIB, HDFINC and HDFLIB
    are set up by the HDFEOS environment scripts (see User Setup, above).
    They refer to the include and library directories for HDFEOS and HDF,
    respectively.
    
    The INCLUDE macro should be included in all compilation statements.
    The LIBRARY an LDFLAGS macros should be included in all link statements.



Notes
=====

    1)  Approved platforms

        HDFEOS was built and tested in a multi-platform environment.
        The list of approved platforms, which includes information about 
        operating system and compiler versions, may be found in the
        HDFEOS User's Guide.


    2)  Architecture type names

        To track architecture dependencies, HDFEOS defines the 
        environment variable $BRAND.  Following is a list of valid values 
        for this variable, which is referred to throughout this document:

        $BRAND	Architecture
        ======	============

        dec 	   DEC Alpha
        hp 	   HP 9000
        ibm 	   IBM RS-6000
	sgi	   IRIX 5.3;6.2
        sgi 	   SGI Power Challenge (old-style 32-bit mode)
        sgi32 	   SGI Power Challenge (new-style 32-bit mode)
        sgi64 	   SGI Power Challenge (64-bit mode)
        sun4 	   Sun: SunOS 4.x
        sun5 	   Sun: SunOS 5.x
        linux      Linux: Red Hat 7.0
	linux64    SuSE Linux (Opteron): 2.4.19-SMP
	IA64       Linux: 2.4.21-sgi240rp04032500_10054
	Macintosh  Darwin6.8
	Windows    98/NT: Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

    3)  Directory and file environment variables

        In order to use the HDFEOS libraries and utilities, a number of
        environment variables MUST be set up to point to HDFEOS directories
        and files.  These variables are automatically set up in User Account 
        Setup section of the installation instructions.  They are 
        listed here for reference:

	name			value			   description
	====			=====			   ===========

	HDFEOS_HOME 		<install-path>/hdfeos	   top-level directory

	(where <install-path> is the absolute directory path above hdfeos)

	HDFEOS_BIN 		$HDFEOS_HOME/bin/$BRAND	  executable files
	HDFEOS_INC 		$HDFEOS_HOME/include      header files
	HDFEOS_LIB 		$HDFEOS_HOME/lib/$BRAND   library files
	HDFEOS_OBJ 		$HDFEOS_HOME/obj/$BRAND   object files
	HDFEOS_SRC 		$HDFEOS_HOME/src          source files


    4)  Other environment variables

        In addition, the makefiles which are used to build the libraries
        require certain machine-specific environment variables.  These set
        compilers, compilation flags and libraries, allowing a single set of
        makefiles to serve on multiple platforms.  The User Account Setup 
        section of the installation instructions explains how to set them up.  
        They are listed here for reference:
       
	name			description
	====	 		===========

	CC 			C compiler
	CFLAGS 			default C flags (optimize, ANSI)
	C_CFH 			C w/ cfortran.h callable from FORTRAN
	CFHFLAGS 		CFLAGS + C_CFH
	C_F77_CFH 		C w/ cfortran.h calling FORTRAN
	C_F77_LIB 		FORTRAN lib called by C main
	F77 			FORTRAN compiler
	F77FLAGS		common FORTRAN flags
	F77_CFH			FORTRAN callable from C w/ cfortran.h
	F77_C_CFH 	 	FORTRAN calling C w/ cfortran.h
	CFH_F77 		same as F77_C_CFH
	F77_C_LIB  		C lib called by FORTRAN main
