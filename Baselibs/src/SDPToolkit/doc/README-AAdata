This section covers installation of the data files needed to use the 
Ancillary/Auxiliary (AA) data access tools.  These files include the
Digital Chart of the World and other earth sciences data sets.  See 
the User's Guide for a listing of these data sets.  If you do not plan 
to use these tools or data sets, it is not necessary to install the
files.

These files will require approximately 260 Mb of disk space.  They may
be installed in any location, i.e. they do not have to be stored under
the SDP Toolkit home directory.

The tool PGS_AA_DCW MUST have access to the files contained in the four
directories named /soamafr, /sasaus, /noamer, /eurnasia in order to work.
These files comprise about 80 Mbytes.  The other tools (PGS_AA_2/3DRead
PGS_AA_2/3DGeo, PGS_AA_DEM) are designed to work with a large range of 
gridded data sets.  Those in the distribution file are samples of data 
from NGDC which need not be maintained by the user; i.e. the user should 
delete which ever are not pertinent.  These files comprise about 180 Mbytes.

The files may be installed in any location, i.e. they do not have to be 
stored under the SDP Toolkit home directory.

The installation script for the AA tools data files is included as part 
of the main SDP Toolkit distribution.   Due to space constraints,  the
data files themselves are located in a separate compressed tar file, called 
SDPTK5.1v1.00-AAdata.tar.Z, which must be downloaded separately.

You must first install the SDP Toolkit BEFORE installing the AA tools data
files.  

The AA tools data files installation requires a disk partition with about 
400 Mb of free space.


To install the AA tools data files from the distribution file:

1)  Run the INSTALL-AAdata script

    a) If you have you already modified your login files, as per section
    8 of the toolkit installation instructions, simply type:

        INSTALL-AAdata

    from any directory.  

    b) If you haven't yet done this, then proceed by typing the following:

        cd <SDP-home-dir>
        bin/INSTALL-AAdata

    where <SDP-home-dir> is the full path of the SDP home directory.

2)  The script contians a default name for the distribution file containing
    the AA tools data files.  That name should be correct for the current
    release of the toolkit.  The script will display the default distribution
    file name and prompt the user for an override.   If the name is correct,
    press return to continue.   If installing from a different distribution
    file for any reason, please enter the name and press return.

3)  By default, the script looks for the distribution file in your current 
    directory and also in <SDP-home-dir>.  If the file is found in one of 
    the default locations, the script will continue to the next step. 
    Otherwise, please enter the correct location when the script prompts 
    for it.  

4)  The script then asks where the AAdata directory will be created.  The
    default is <SDP-home-dir>.  If you want it installed elsewhere, please
    enter the pathname when the script prompts for the location.  Otherwise,
    simply hit return to continue.

5)  The script asks you to verify the information entered. Type 'y' and hit 
    return to continue.   The contents of the distribution file are then 
    extracted into the specified location.  Please note that this is a
    lengthy process that will probably take somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5
    hours, depending on your host.

6)  The script then asks if the Process Control File should be patched so 
    that the PRODUCT INPUT FILES directory is set to point to the AA data
    directory.  The default is yes.   If you answer no, you must edit the
    Process Control File yourself, in order for the AA tools to work.

7)  The script then asks if the distribution file should be removed.  The 
    default is no.  Once you are satisfied that the files have successfully 
    been installed, you will probably want to get rid of this file, as it 
    takes up lots of disk space.

    If you wish to get a listing of the files contained in the distribution 
    file, for verification purposes, follow the steps below.  Please be aware 
    that this is no small task, as there are literally thousands of data files 
    contained in the distribution file.   To see the listing, go to the 
    directory where the distribution file is located and type: 

        zcat SDPTK5.1v1.00-AAdata.tar.Z | tar tvf -

    You may wish to pipe the output to the Unix 'more' command, to allow you
    to see a screen at a time:

        zcat SDPTK5.1v1.00-AAdata.tar.Z | tar tvf - | more


This completes the installation of the AA tools data files.
