    PGS_CBP_EPH_asc2eph.f  by Edmund Larson, Peter Noerdlinger, and
    Marek Chmielowski with
               the reduced Julian Date range:

       		T1 = 2436175.5D0
       		T2 = 2459215.5D0

  The filename used by EOSDIS for this version, in binary, is:

  de200.EOS and is located in $PGSLIB/database/EPH directory

  These ephemerides are used for the retrieval of the ephemeris data: 
  cartesian coordinates of the major planets, moon and sun at any 
  requested time (JED) covered by the ephemeris.

  The original ephemeris on which de200.EOS is based is a J2000-based
  ephemeris:  de200 , running from JED2305424.5  (1599 DEC 09)  to  
  JED 2513360.5  (2169 MAR 31).   The EOS version de200.EOS was checked
  against the jpl test data file "testpo.200" and performed identically
  with the full de200, with the exception that on the SGI platform 
  de200.EOS showed a sprinkling of error of one part in 1e13 where
  the full epehemeris did not.  The error is insignificant, but the
  matter is under study.

  The original version is so large that it was deemed unwieldy to
  be sent with the PGS Toolkit.

  The version supplied by the PGS Toolkit in April, 1994 is unlatered
  other than by direct coding to binary with the jpl program.  In the
  process its time span was slightly shortened.   It is anticipated 
  that in the near future the EOSDIS ephemerides will be corrected for 
  light travel time to the Earth and for aberration due to the Earth's 
  orbital motion.  The two corrections will not exceed 1 minute arc.

The original JPL description of DE118 and DE 200 is:

DE118: created in 1980, was based on the (1950) equator and equinox of the FK4.
       It was used to create DE200.

DE200: created from DE118 by rotating all coordinates onto the equator and 
       equinox of J2000 (FK5).  This ephemeris has been the basis of the 
       Astronomical Almanac since 1984.
