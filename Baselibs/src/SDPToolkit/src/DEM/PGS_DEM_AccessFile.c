/*******************************************************
PGS_DEM_AccessFile--

This function opens, closes and keeps a record of the staged files. It's primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of the DEM tools.  Previously, everytime a
file was accessed, it needed to be opened and the GRID needed to be attached.
This function allows these files to be opened and the GRIDS to be attached only
once in the DEM functionality.  There are three modes, or commands, which
regulate the functionality of PGS_DEM_AccessFile:

PGSd_DEM_ACCESS -- In this case, the particular file has been opened
and the GRID has been attached outside of this function.  The hdfID and
gdID's already have been assigned to the particular subgrid of the subset. In
this case, the function merely records the file specific info.

PGSd_DEM_OPEN -- This function determines if a file has been opened and
attached. If it has, it assigns the file info to the subgrid.  If the file has
not been opened, it is opened, attached to, and the file info is recorded both
in the subset and internally to this function.

PGSd_DEM_CLOSE -- This function closes and detaches from all of the files of a
particular subset.


Presently, it is assumed that there never will be greater than
PGSd_DEM_MAX_STAGED (200) DEM files staged at anyone time in the PCF. If at some
point in the futre, this is a possibl;e situation, this code must be modified.
In that eventuality, one would only leave the most recently accessed files open
and leave any files greater than PGSd_DEM_MAX_STAGED closed.  

Assumption:
all commands assume that the particular subgrid of the subset has space
allocated for it.
  Assign-- assumes that FileRecord fields hdfID and gdID have been already
  inputed into the subset.
