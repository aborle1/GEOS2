The files in this directory come directly from the udunits package
(see COPYRIGHT, ORIGIN and VERSION files).  The version in use here
is 1.11.5 (unless the file VERSION indicates a later version).

The files in the distribution tar file "udunits.tar.Z" have been somewhat
rearranged and the makefile is NOT based on the udunits Makefile (i.e. it
is an SDP Toolkit original).

The files in this directory come from the tar file directory:

udunits-1.11.5/src/lib

The file udunits.dat from that direcotry has been moved to the Toolkit
database directory: $PGSHOME/database/common/CUC.

The include file from the (above udunits) directory as well as several include
files from the tar file directory:

udunits-1.11.5/port/misc

have been moved to $PGSINC/CUC.

All files were created by untarring the distribution tar file and running
"configure" in the directory:

udunits-1.11.5/src

on a SunOS 5.5.1 platform (the configure program was also run on the following
standard UNIX platforms: dec, hp, ibm, sgi--no significant differences in
source code or include files were found, so the files from the sun5 configure
are used here for all platforms).

No udunits source code or include files have been otherwise modified.
